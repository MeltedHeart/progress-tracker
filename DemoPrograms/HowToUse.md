# Demo Programs

Programs are what save files are called inside the Progress Tracker. They include all Projects, Tasks, Updates, Notes, etc.

These are a couple of test Programs you can use to test the Progress Tracker and/or see how it works.

## How to use

Simply move all files to the ProgramData folder inside the ProgressTracker folder in My Documents. You must run the Progress Tracker at least once before doing this.
